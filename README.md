## Motivation
> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

Whenever we are learning anything, writing about it gives us a better understanding. And when we write keeping in mind that our work would be read by people we tend to give more thought over it. This is how the human brain functions.

This repository is an organized collection all aspects of web development which we face daily.
